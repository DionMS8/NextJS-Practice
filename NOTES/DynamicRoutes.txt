=====[DYNAMIC ROUTING]==========================================================================

=> DYNAMIC ROUTING REFERS TO PATHS WHICH 
CONTAIN PARAMETERS THAT MAY VARY BASED ON 
THE REQUEST.

=> FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE NEED TO ACCESS A 
USER PROFILE BASED ON THE NAME THAT IS 
CLICKED, THE ROUTE MAY LOOK LIKE 
"/USERS/NAME" WHERE THE NAME PARAMETER CAN 
VARY. TO CREATE THE PROFILE PAGE COMPONENT, 
THE FILE SHOULD BE NAMED [NAME].JS TO 
INDICATE THAT NAME IS A DYNAMIC 
ROUTE PARAMETER.

=====[NEXT.JS]==============================================================================

- CREATED BY VERCEL 
- A FRAMEWORK THAT IMPROVES REACT APPS 
- SERVER-SIDE RENDERING (SSR)
- STATIC SITE GENERATION (SSG)

NOTE: WITHOUT NEXTJS, REACT LOADS AND RENDERS 
THE PAGES ON THE CLIENT-SIDE IN THE BROWSER

BENEFITS
=> PRE-RENDERING IMPROVES PERFORMANCE METRICS 
SUCH AS FIRST CONTENTFUL PAINT, WHICH INDICATES 
THE TIME AT WHICH THE FIRST TEXT OR IMAGE IS 
PAINTED ON A WEB PAGE 

=> BETTER SEO BECAUSE THE SERVER ALWAYS 
DELIVERS A WEB PAGE WITH ALL OF IT'S CONTENT 
AND ASSETS. THEREFORE, THE CONTENT IS VISIBLE 
TO SEARCH ENGINES AND SOCIAL MEDIA BOTS.


=====[IMPORTANT TOPICS]==================================================================

=> REDIRECTS

=> THE <Link href=""> COMPONENT ALLOWS FOR 
CLIENT-SIDE NAVIGATION IN THE BROWSER BETWEEN 
THE PAGES OF THE APPLICATION. THIS IS MUCH 
FASTER SINCE PAGES ARE LOADED IN USING JS 
INSTEAD OF HTML PAGE REQUESTS USING ANCHOR 
TAGS <a> ALONE. IT USES THE href PROP TO 
PROVIDE THE PATH FOR THE PAGE.

<Link href="/page">
    <a>text for link....</a>
</Link>
